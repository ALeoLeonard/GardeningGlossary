  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"The term angiosperm refers to any member of the flowering plant species. There are more than 290,000 living species of plants that are considered angiosperms and they are the most diverse plant group in the world. Angiosperms have been present since the Early Cretaceous period and can be found in nearly all habitats."},
    {"paragraph2":"An angiosperm may also be known as a flowering plant, angiospermae or magnoliophyta."}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"Angiosperms are found in a vast variety of shapes and sizes, and can be terrestrial or aquatic plants. They include, but are not limited to, shrubs, herbs, vines, and trees. Although angiosperms vary in shape and size, they all consist of three basic body parts: leaves, stems and roots."},
    {"paragraph2":"Most angiosperms propagate in the same fashion. Propagation occurs inside of the plant ovary, which is usually enclosed inside of a flower. Inside the ovary, the ovule, or egg, is fertilized and develops into a seed. Fruits are a product of this process and are a characteristic of an angiosperm."},
    {"paragraph3":"Angiosperms are an important food source for many animals, including humans. However, angiosperms are not limited to being a resource for food; they are also very important economically. Angiosperms serve as a source of ornamental plants, timber, clothing fiber and medicine."}
