  "tags":["Plant Biology"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"Amino acids are organic compounds that form proteins. They are considered to be the building blocks of life. They are made up of key elements, such as carbon and hydrogen. Amino acids are biologically significant and play an important role in nutrition for both animals and plants. Additionally, synthetic amino acids are used in industrial and commercial products."},
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"Plants create amino acids from primary elements they absorb from the environment. Carbon and oxygen are obtained from the air. Hydrogen and nitrogen are obtained from the soil. Inside the plant, amino acids are formed through metabolic pathways. Plants, like all other forms of life, require amino acids to create cells. These cells are then used to build various vital parts of a plant like roots and leaves."},
    {"paragraph2":"Although plants can collect the resources necessary to create their own amino acids, many gardeners and farmers use amino acids alone as fertilizer for plants. These types of amino acid supplements can be applied to plants directly by way of a spray application, or applied into soil. Amino acids used as fertilizer, when properly applied, can have several notable effects on plants."},
    {"paragraph3":"Some of the effects of supplemental amino acids are improved photosynthesis, an increase in a plantâ€™s tolerance to environmental factors, and boosted plant fertility. Amino acids, when applied to plants through a spray application or in the soil, provide plants with the nutrients they need for healthy growth. Additionally, amino acids added as a nutritional supplement help a plant to better absorb the key nutrients they need to naturally create more amino acids."}
