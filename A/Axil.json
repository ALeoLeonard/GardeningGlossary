  "tags":["Botany"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"An axil is the angle between the upper side of a leaf and the stem from which it grows. Knowing the location of the axil helps you to locate the bud, because in flowering plants buds develop in the axils of leaves. These types of buds are known as axillary buds."},
    {"paragraph2":"An axil can also be the position above a leaf scar."}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"Axil is derived from the Latin word axillia."},
    {"paragraph2":"In botany, an axil is important as it can help to identify the species of a plant. Knowing this information can help horticulturalists better care for their plants by searching for methods specific to a particular plantâ€™s care. While the axil does not directly contribute to a plant, it indirectly helps in its identification and care as it can help identify the location of the bud."}
