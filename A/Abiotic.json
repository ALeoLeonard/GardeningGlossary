  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"There are a variety of abiotic factors that are responsible for a plant's well-being. The factors include (but are not limited to) temperature, light, soil structure, moisture in air and chemicals prevalent in soil and water. The varieties of abiotic factors are responsible for the types of plants that can grow in a particular location. For example, it might be impossible to grow rosemary in a desert due to some abiotic factors such as a high temperature and insufficient soil moisture levels."}
