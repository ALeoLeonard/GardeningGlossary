  "term":"Alkaline",
  "tags":["Soil"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"Alkaline refers to a nutrient solution or growing media with a pH greater than 7. Alkaline soils are normally composed of various types of materials such as calcium carbonate. Highly alkaline soils are more prevalent in dry regions. Because soil pH is directly linked to nutrient availability, alkaline soils tend to have a deficiency in phosphorus, zinc, and iron."}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"In some cases, the soil can develop an elevated alkaline level if it is watered with hard water fortified with lime. Excessively alkaline soil can lead to stunted growth in plants because high pH levels decrease nutrient absorption. However, some plants actually thrive in alkaline soils. These include evergreen shrubs, perennials, and deciduous shrubs."},
    {"paragraph2":"To enhance the soilâ€™s ability to retain nutrients and water, it is advisable to treat it with well-rotted manure or other organic matter prior to planting."},
    {"paragraph3":"Some plants such as heathers, camellias, and rhododendrons tend to produce lower-quality flowers when placed in alkaline soils. In such cases, it is advisable to completely avoid synthetic fertilizers since these can make the soil even more alkaline."}
