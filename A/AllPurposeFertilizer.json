    {"paragraph1":"An all-purpose fertilizer is a type of fertilizer that includes adequate amounts of the three core chemicals to ensure proper growth: nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK)."},
    {"paragraph2":"A plant's growth and the quality of its components depend on several factors such as temperature, light intensity, water, and chemical nutrients. Plants mostly need the three core chemicals."},
    {"paragraph3":"Each chemical serves a different purpose. Nitrogen is responsible for the physical growth of plants, phosphorous is important for a plant’s respiration, and potassium is necessary to overcome various diseases."},

  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"All-purpose fertilizers are widely used by most horticulturalists, and it was invented because some people believed that organic fertilizers didn’t fulfill the chemical requirements completely. However, optimizing the concentration of all three of the core chemicals (NPK) is essential to growing healthy plants."},
    {"paragraph2":"Although fertilizers help plants grow, increasing the use of chemical fertilizers does not necessarily equate to increased yield. It is important to thoroughly ascertain the needs of the plants as well as the amount of NPK existing in the soil to determine if additional fertilizers are required. Plants may face adverse consequences by using more than the necessary amount of chemical fertilizers."}
