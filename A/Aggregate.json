  "tags":["Water Supply"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"An aggregate is a combination of two or more materials in order to form one. In landscaping, this generally entails a combination of stone and cement."},
    {"paragraph2":"An aggregate patio block, for example, is one where cement is used as a base to form the actual block, and small pebbles, usually river rock, which are set into it as the surface material."},
    {"paragraph3":""},
    {"paragraph4":""}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"Almost any garden structure or walkway can be an aggregate because an aggregate is a simple process for a unique, do-it-yourself garden feature, as long as there is a small, preferably smooth stone readily available and a medium such as cement to press it into."},
    {"paragraph2":"Birdbaths, garden ornaments, and garden statues are also often aggregate. Again, cement is used to form the base and small stones are pressed into it."},
    {"paragraph3":"Aggregate is a common landscape feature most often used for walkways that have been built of aggregate patio stone or for garden statuary."}
