  "term":"Aerate",
  "tags":["Soil"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"Aeration refers to the act of perforating your garden soil to enable nutrients, water, and air to reach the plants and their roots. This helps the plants develop stronger roots."},
    {"paragraph2":"Aeration also delivers a more vigorous lawn while helping with issues related to soil compaction. In fact, a lack of aeration can cause a rather significant builtup of organic debris underneath the grass, which prevents nutrients from reaching the roots."}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"There are a few factors to consider before deciding whether the lawn should be aerated or not because excessive aeration can be detrimental to the plantâ€™s health."},
    {"paragraph2":"However, if the lawn has a spongy feel to it, or if it tends to dry out easily, gardeners might want to perforate the soil for better air and nutrient circulation"},
    {"paragraph3":"Homeowners who have pets and children running on the grass might also want to consider aeration because heavy use tends to dry out the soil. Vegetable patches should preferably be aerated during the growing season."},
    {"paragraph4":"Different types of tools may be used for aeration, but the two most popular ones are plug and spike aerators. Plug aerators are designed to remove the actual core of soil and grass from the ground, while spike ones can be used to manually poke a series of holes directly into the soil."},
    {"paragraph5":"Professional nurserymen often use larger machines designed specifically for this purpose. It is important to ensure that the ground is humid enough before starting to aerate."}
