  "term":"Ammonium Nitrate",
  "tags":["Plant Nutrition"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"Ammonium nitrate refers to an organic waste of nitrogen present in fertilizers. Ammonium nitrate is also produced in the soil as organic matter breaks down, but in some cases the soil naturally lacks this chemical compound. Consequently, some gardeners need to add additional ammonium nitrate to encourage and enhance plant growth. The nitrogen present in ammonium nitrate is particularly helpful for green, leafy plants."}

  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"Ammonium nitrate was an extremely popular form of fertilizer in the 1940s. Because it is inexpensive and easy to produce, this element is often favored by horticulturalists. Unlike other fertilizers, ammonium nitrate is virtually colorless and odorless. It is often used in large-scale and commercial growing because it supplies a steady stream of nitrogen, hence increasing the plant's quality and growth."},
    {"paragraph2":"Ammonium nitrate enhances phosphorus absorption, which is once again advantageous to plants."}
