  "tags":[""],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"Aquaculture is the practice of growing aquatic animals and plants for food."},
    {"paragraph2":"The advantage of aquaculture over commercial fishing or gathering wild aquatic plants is that aquaculture occurs in a more controlled environment and virtually guarantees a consistent quality and yield."}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"Aquaculture can be anything from the cultivation of specialty saltwater algae to the raising of shrimp, oysters, or freshwater trout. There are forms of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture that integrates fish and plant farming."},
    {"paragraph2":"Most freshwater algae is toxic, therefore all of the seaweed grown via aquaculture is a saltwater variety. Although there are varieties that can irritate the stomach lining if it is not properly processed, seaweed is nutritious and has many uses in cooking (e.g., as a wrap for sushi, in a soup) and is even considered a natural laxative."},
    {"paragraph3":"Besides a consistent harvest of a specific species of fish, aquaculture can assure a product free of heavy metals and common pollutants present under natural conditions."}
