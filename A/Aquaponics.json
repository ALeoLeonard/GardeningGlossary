  "tags":["Aquaponics"],
  "definition": [
    {"paragraph1":"Aquaponics can best be described as the combination of traditional hydroponics and aquaculture. There are two main components to aquaponics: enhancing plant growth and simultaneously raising healthy marine animals. This system is entirely dependent on a variety of live components including bacteria and sometimes worms."},
    {"paragraph2":"Extremely popular in China, this horticultural method has a long history due to its efficiency in growing plants."}
  ],
  "explanation": [
    {"paragraph1":"The plants that are best adapted to aquaponics include, but are not limited to, watercress, herbs, chives, basil, Chinese cabbage and spinach. Some horticulturists can also grow lettuce using the aquaponics method, but this is not a widespread technique. Vegetables and fruits with a higher density and nutrient requirements such as cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers require a far higher fish density."},
    {"paragraph2":"Fish excrement is an excellent fertilizer for the plants. Many fish famers choose to raise freshwater fish, along with prawns and crayfish. Tilapia is a very popular choice because this particular fish is practically immune to the rapidly changing water conditions. They are also tolerant of the crowding that occurs in aquaponics tanks. Other types of fish found in aquaponics include the Murray cod, Jade Perch, Tandanus Catfish, Eel-tailed Catfish and the Barramudi."}
